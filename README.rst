Rooki is a client for roocs_ climate data operations service (rook_).

The rooki python package is a lightweight wrapper around the birdy_ client library for WPS.
It provides the *rooki* python object that has methods that can be called to query and invoke
the rook_ WPS.

A Jupyter Notebook is provided to demonstrate the basic use of rooki.

Full documentation_ is on ReadTheDocs.
